webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.

Create the divs using JavaScript

grid squares inside another “container” div

CSS Grid

borders and margins, as they can adjust the size of the squares!

Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.

Hint: “Hovering” is what happens when your mouse enters a div and ends when your mouse leaves it. You can set up event listeners for either of those events as a starting point.

There are multiple ways to change the color of the divs, including:
adding a new class to the div.
changing the div’s background color using JavaScript.

Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. 

Once entered
the existing grid should be removed
new grid should be generated
same total space as before
(e.g. 960px wide)

Tip: Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100. 

Research button tags in HTML
how you can make a JavaScript function 
run when one is clicked.

Also check out prompts.

You should be able to enter 64
and have a brand new 64x64 grid
pop up without changing the total amount of pixels used.

Instead of just changing
